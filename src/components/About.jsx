        <p className="my-2">I'm a web developer with experience in <span className="font-bold">React, JavaScript, GraphQL, and modern web technologies</span>. I enjoy building intuitive, high-performing applications that prioritize accessibility and user experience.</p>
        <p>I earned my bachelor's degree from <span className="font-bold">Brigham Young University–Idaho</span>, where I developed a strong foundation in web development and software engineering principles. Through internships at <span className="font-bold">BYU-I and FamilySearch</span>, I’ve worked on full-stack and front-end projects, contributing to API integrations, performance optimizations, and accessible design. I love working on projects that solve real problems and improve the way people interact with technology.</p>
        <p className="my-2">I'm always learning and refining my skills, excited about new challenges that push me to grow as a developer. But when I am not at my computer, I like to spend my time reading, playing with my two adorable cats and playing video games with my husband.</p>
